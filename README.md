 This project typically involves collecting datasets of labeled spam and non-spam emails, preprocessing text data (removing stop words, stemming, and vectorizing), and training models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning algorithms. Key features include email metadata, word frequencies, and content patterns. Effective spam detection enhances cybersecurity, reduces phishing risks, and improves user productivity by keeping inboxes clutter-free.
